# Library and Utilities

The [lib/](mdc:lib/) directory contains utility functions, hooks, and helper code:

## Styles
- [lib/styles.ts](mdc:lib/styles.ts) - Utility functions for styling and class merging

## Hooks
- [lib/hooks/](mdc:lib/hooks/) - Custom React hooks for reusable stateful logic

## Storage
- [lib/local-storage/](mdc:lib/local-storage/) - Utilities for working with browser extension storage APIs

These utilities help maintain clean, DRY code throughout the extension and abstract browser-specific APIs into reusable functions.
