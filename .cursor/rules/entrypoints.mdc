# Extension Entrypoints

The extension has several entry points that define different parts of its functionality:

## Background
- [entrypoints/background.ts](mdc:entrypoints/background.ts) - Main background script entry
- [entrypoints/background/](mdc:entrypoints/background/) - Additional background script modules

## Content Scripts
- [entrypoints/content.ts](mdc:entrypoints/content.ts) - Main content script injected into web pages

## UI Components
- [entrypoints/popup/](mdc:entrypoints/popup/) - Extension popup UI
- [entrypoints/dashboard/](mdc:entrypoints/dashboard/) - Dashboard page UI

These entry points follow WXT's convention for automatically generating the extension's manifest and bundling each entry point separately.
