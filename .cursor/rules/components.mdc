# Components

The project uses React components organized as follows:

## UI Components
The [components/ui/](mdc:components/ui/) directory contains reusable UI components following a component library pattern:

- [components/ui/button.tsx](mdc:components/ui/button.tsx) - Button component with various styles and variants
- [components/ui/card.tsx](mdc:components/ui/card.tsx) - Card container component
- [components/ui/spinner.tsx](mdc:components/ui/spinner.tsx) - Loading spinner component
- [components/ui/table.tsx](mdc:components/ui/table.tsx) - Table component

## Feature Components
- [components/theme-toggle.tsx](mdc:components/theme-toggle.tsx) - Toggle component for switching between light and dark themes

These components use Tailwind CSS for styling and are built following modern React patterns including composition and hooks.
